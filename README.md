# Grocery List Tracker

## Overview:
A grocery list tracker program that reads a grocery list from a text file. It allows users to search for specific items to find their frequency in the list. Additionally, the program offers options to display the entire list and the frequency of each item, represented either as a number or a histogram. Upon termination, the program creates and saves a separate text file containing the entire list with the corresponding numerical frequency of each item.

## Menu Options:
1. Item Search (allows the user to search for an item by name to find and output the frequency)
2. Numerical Item Frequency (prints the list of items with the corresponding amount next to each item represented as a number)
3. Histogram Item Frequency (prints the list of items with the corresponding amount next to each item represented as asterisks)
4. Exit Program (terminates the program and creates a text file to output the list with the numerical item frequency)
