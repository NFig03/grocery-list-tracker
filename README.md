# CPlusPlusProgram

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
-This project is a simulated grocery store tracker. It allows users to input a file with a list of items, 
and then be prompted with a menu allowing them to choose between the option of searching for an item by
name to find the frequency, print the list of items with the number indicating the amount next to it, or a
third option allowing the user to print the list of items with the corresponding number of asterisks to the 
right. The fourth option in the menu they are prompted with allows them to terminate the program. The 
problem also goes ahead and creates a .txt file which it outputs the list that was input with the frequency
represented by a number to the right. 

# What did you do particularly well?
-What I did particularly well with this project is modularizing my code and ensuring that it was clean,
concise, and followed industry standard best practices.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
-I could enhance the code by creating clearer and more distinguishable variable names. I could also provide
better formatting on the histogram output page by aligning the asterisks. The first change would improve my
code by making it more easily understandable for anyone working on the code. The second change would improve
the overally user experience. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? 
# What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
-The piece of code that was most challenging for me was the log file which is an object that the program
creates. The reason it was very challenging for me was because the log constructor received a map as
input. As this was my first time working with maps, it took me a while to understand the proper syntax.
I overcame this slight hiccup by doing a bit of research on maps and by reading over the code of others'
programs containing maps. The tool I am adding to my support network is the website W3 Schools. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
-The skills from this project that I can derive and transfer to my other pieces of work are my
newfound knowledge of maps, prioritizing modularized and concise code, clear and concise commenting,
as well as working with files. 

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
-In order to make this code maintainable, I ensured that all my code was well commented, I used mostly
clear variable names, I used proper formatting, and I modularized all of my code. This code is easily readable
as I used proper formatting, commenting, naming conventions, and spacing. The code is easily adaptable
due to my modularization of code and functions. If we consider the functions to be blocks, we simply need to add and
subtract blocks based on the needs.
